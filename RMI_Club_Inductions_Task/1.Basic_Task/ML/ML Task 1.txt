1) The second model is the best fit to the data-set
2)

Graph 1
	
Problem:Underfitting
* The predicted curve is underfitting the given data points.So the predicition is not accurate.
* This basically happens when the model has a very high bias. That is, the model over-assumes the data-set and hence may have a limited capacity to learn complex patterns.
* Due to the simplicity of the model, the variance of the model is very less.

Graph 3

Problem:Overfitting
* The predicted curve is overfitting the given data points.So the graph is more focussed on covering all the points rather than being a genral graph for all kinds of points
* This kind of models has high variance. So the graph is more complex and is composed of higher degeree terms

Graph 2
* Has a good trade-off between bias and variance level
* Serves as a genral curve for all kinds of data points

3)Ways to avoid over-fitting

* Collect as much data points as possible
* Don't set too much parameters for a particular dataset. Consider only the necessary parameters
* Regularization:
	 Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller parameter values. It reduces the contribution from the weights of the higher degeree terms to have a simpler curve
